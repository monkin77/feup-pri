                        IndWish is a web application that allows users to search for companies and view their information.
                        The application was built in the context of the Information Retrieval course at the Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto.
                        Developed by Bruno Rosendo, Jo√£o Mesquita and Rui Alves, students of the Master in Computer Science and Engineering, 
                        in the 2022/2023 academic year, the application aims to provide a simple and intuitive way to search for companies and view their information.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style={styles.subTitles}>How to perform a search</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are a lot of searches that can be made. The most basic one is simply search for a specific topic, using 
                        the default search on the company name, industry and description.
                        <br/>

                        The system also allows term boost searches, where the user can specify a term and a boost value. The boost value
                        is a number that indicates how much more important that term is than the others. For example, if the user searches for
                        "economy in technology^2" with a boost value of 2 in technology, the results retrieved will focus
                        more on the technology than in economy.
                    </p>


                    <h2 style={styles.subTitles}>How to view a company's information</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the results page, the user as two columns: one with all the results, and other showing the details of the selected
                        result. The details of the company are shown in the right column of the screen, in a card. To see the details
                        of other result/company, you simply have to right click on the desired result on the left column and the details on
                        the right one will switch to the new company.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style={styles.subTitles}>How does the system get the results</h2>
                    <p>
                        The application is built using React. 
                        <br/>
                        The data is indexed in Solr and when performing a search, the system retrieves the results provided from Solr and shows them to the user.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
