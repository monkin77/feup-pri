On this query, we are searching for companies in the area of health manufacturing.

This is a complicated task for the search system because there are companies only of the 
Healthcare or Manufacturing Industry. Despite that, the system revelled to work well
on our dataset since the companies have a nice description, getting good relations 
between the words.

By using boosts, we get results more focused on the industry and the description, despite of the name,
which is our objective here. With that, we got improvements on the search, incrementing the recall
and precision at 10 from 0.7 to 0.8.
