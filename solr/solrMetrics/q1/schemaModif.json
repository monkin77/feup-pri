          "description":"https://captioncall.com/careers/\n\nand\n\nhttp://www.sorenson.com/jobs\n\nCaptionCall provides captioned telephones to those who have hearing loss and have difficulty hearing on the telephone. Similar to captioned television, CaptionCall uses advanced technology and a captioning agent to quickly provide written captions of what callers say on a large, easy-to-read screen.\n\nCaptionCall is only made available to individuals who have a medically recognized hearing disability necessitating their use of the service. The CaptionCall service is supported through the federal government’s Interstate Telecommunications Relay Service fund. This fund is established to fulfill the mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to provide functionally-equivalent communications to people with hearing loss. The CaptionCall service uses captioning agents who convert the calling party’s spoken words into captioned text. – less",
