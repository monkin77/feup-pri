        "description":["Wireless Zone is the largest Verizon franchisor in the U.S. with over 400 locations. For over 30 years, we’ve provided Verizon products and services in our independently owned and operated stores. We’re proud of our knowledgeable, friendly staff recognized by Verizon as the National Customer Loyalty Award Winner for 5 consecutive years. Our franchise has also been recognized by Entrepreneur Magazine Franchise 500, Franchise Times Top 200 and Bonds Franchise World Top 100.\n\nThe Wireless Zone Foundation for Giving® is a large part of what sets Wireless Zone® apart from our competition. It was founded in 2003 with the realization that as local business owners, we wanted to support our communities as much as they support us.\n\nToday we continue to raise a significant amount of money and support a large number of local and national charities and causes. We have time-honored relationships with Autism Speaks, Make-A-Wish, Children’s Tumor Foundation, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Best Friends Animal Society, Homes for Our Troops, Sandy Hook Promise and No Kid Hungry by Share Our Strength.\n\nEveryone at Wireless Zone®, from franchisees to corporate employees, plays a role in our efforts to give back. On top of our system-wide fundraising campaigns, each year Wireless Zone® franchisees and employees nominate a local charity for a Foundation grant. We’ve shown year after year that we really can positively impact the lives of those around us in meaningful ways. – less"],
