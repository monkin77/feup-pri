          "description":"It's all about connections, connections, connections -- and Tensolite, dba Carlisle Interconnect Technologies, is well connected. Carlisle Interconnect designs and manufactures high-performance wire and cable, radio-frequency/microwave connectors, and cable assemblies for the commercial and military aircraft, defense electronics, wireless infrastructure, optical telecommunications, and test and measurement industries. It has operations in California, China, Florida, and Washington. In 2008 Tensolite acquired Carlyle Inc., and the merger was re-branded Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. It is part of the Applied Technologies segment of parent company Carlisle Companies.\n\nThe two companies combined staffs, technologies, and products to create Carlisle Interconnect Technologies -- a single company focused on the expansion of its product and technical capabilities. It specializes in aerospace grade copper and optical fiber cable assemblies and harnesses used in wing, cockpit, and avionics systems. The assemblies connect to instrumentation, sensors, and other types of system support and control devices. Carlisle Interconnect Technologies also manufactures coaxial cables, microwave connectors, electrical panel and cabinet assemblies, as well as provides electronic engineering, design, and manufacturing services to OEMs in military and aerospace, test and measurement, automatic test equipment, and medical and industrial markets. Brand products include Tensolite High-Density Shielded Interconnects (HDSI), High Density RF Interconnect (HDRFI), Tufflite 2000 airframe wire, and NETflight optic cable, to name a few.\n\nDue to the global economic recession, Carlisle Interconnect Technologies was forced to close its cable manufacturing plant in Vancouver, Canada, in late 2009. Production was moved to one of the company's three US facilities. Carlisle Interconnect Technologies explained that one of its largest customers, Tektronix, was hard hit, as well, by the recession, and had to decrease its orders. \n\nBut amid economic difficulties and low demand, the company welcomed new acquisition Electronic Cable Specialists (ECS) in October 2009. Wisconsin-based ECS designs and manufactures electrical and structural products and services for use in aviation, industrial, and medical applications. ECS is expected to complement the company's specialty wire and cable operations and expand its engineering capabilities for customers in the avionics and commercial aircraft industries. Also in 2009, to boost its portfolio for defense electronics and avionics for military and commercial aerospace applications, the company acquired Jerrik, a military and aerospace filter connector manufacturer based in Arizona.\n\nCarlyle Inc. was a supplier of aerospace and network interconnection products. It manufactured cable assemblies, rack and panels, and cable and wire harnesses for in-flight entertainment systems and specialty avionics. The acquisition brought new customers and built on Tensolite's product portfolio.\n\nTensolite, the name of which was derived from tensile and lightweight, was founded by Henry Dudley Minich in 1940 as a research laboratory. Its first products were used to heat fighter pilots' gloves and suits electrically in WWII. Four years later the company began focusing on insulated wire. It became part of the Carlisle group of companies in 1960. – less",
