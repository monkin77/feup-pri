    "description":"Founded in 1989 as Harvest Meat Company with offices and distribution centers in Phoenix and San Diego, the vision of Frank Leavy along with sons Jay, Kevin and Dennis was born. The strategy was simple: provide independent food companies that did not have the scale to be self-distributors, the opportunity for access to national and regional brands\/products that included the all-important protein categories of beef, pork, poultry and seafood. While independent food distribution was not new, Harvest Founders launched a strategy that was developed to provide a better way for customers to acquire product. Simply put, the strategy focus was to provide a wide selection of protein items that included solutions to fit any demographic with the brands and products that they demanded. Coupled with high fill rates and on time delivery, access to a wide selection of brands and products was right on target and immediately embraced by customers in Phoenix and San Diego.\n\nFast forward to 2016 and you can witness a growth story that the 600 strong Harvest Family is very proud of as the company operates 10 Distribution Centers supported by 12 sales offices across the United States servicing over 6,000 customers in the retail, foodservice, distribution, manufacturing and further processing segments.\n\nAn integral part of this success is the founder\u2019s commitment to hiring and developing quality people, people that understand our business and more importantly our customer\u2019s businesses. This highly experienced team goes to great lengths to service our customers at a very high level. Harvest Members are the very heart of our business and are represented by professional sales staff, accounting, IT, as well as our warehouse and transportation departments. Armed and supported by state of the art technologies in order processing, inventory control, truck tracking, market information, product handling, and UPC bar-code scanning, the company has evolved into a highly efficient full line marketer and distributor of perishable food products that now includes the fast growing dairy, deli and bakery categories. \u2013 less",

    "description":"Welcome, neighbor! We're glad you're here. Let's start with a quick introduction. We are First Community Credit Union and have deep roots in Oregon. In 1957, 12 teachers in Bandon came together to form a credit union, each contributing $5 to get it started. Fast forward to today, we are among the strongest credit unions in the nation - but still remain true to our local roots. We aren't some big institution from some big metropolis nowhere near here. In fact, we're headquartered right in Coquille. Your kids play where our kids play. Your morning commutes are our morning commutes. And we certainly share your pride and connection to this amazing state.\n\nWhat is the difference between a credit union and a bank? Credit Unions and banks offer similar products and services with one meaningful difference - credit unions serve members, not investors. This means earnings are returned to you in the form of reduced fees, competitive savings rates and lower loan rates. Credit unions, like us, are also not-for-profit financial institutions owned and operated by members, not investors. We are dedicated to the well-being of our members and communities and always put people before profits. \u2013 less",

Black Angus Steakhouse quickly became known as the place to go for great steak and superior service. The restaurant was monumental in introducing Certified Angus Beef to Toronto, a premium steak which is native to Scotland, known for its superb marbling and flavour. Cooked on an open hardwood charcoal grill, the steak is grilled to perfection, and often referred to as \u201cthe best steak in the city\u201d. The grill became a centerpiece, as guests would view their steak being cooked precisely the way they requested, creating a friendly and warm atmosphere for dining. Black Angus Steakhouse remains a place for families, friends and celebrations \u2013 having hosted a number of generations over the past 50 years \u2013 it has become more than a restaurant but rather a tradition.\n\nToday, Black Angus Steakhouse is expanding its tradition by moving to a stunning new restaurant space at the north-east corner of Bloor and Islington. Black Angus Steakhouse is renowned for superb food, excellent service and pleasing ambiance, all of which carry through to our new restaurant. Mixing the old with the new, guests can enjoy lunch and dinner in our elegant dining room or our casual bar area. For larger groups, celebrations and business functions, we have two private rooms to choose from. Our elevated outdoor patio provides a chic setting for seasonal dining. \u2013 less",

As time went on many things changed: Our name, our size, and the ever-growing list of products and services that we offer. We know you will find that our commitment to our communities, to our customers, and to our staff has remained strong.\n\nWe made our first home loan on April 18, 1923, for $500. The proud new owners had a payment of $10.82 per month, wood heat, no electricity and no indoor plumbing! During the lean times of the 1930's we continued to pay dividends to our savings accounts and to make the loans which contributed to the stability and growth of our communities. In the 1940's, First Federal sold war bonds and made money available to returning veterans through the Soldier's and Sailor's Civil Relief Act.\n\nFirst Federal has continued to grow along with the financial needs of our area. Our reason for existence is to supply the community with a safe and sound bank where we encourage savings and invest those savings by making loans to you and your neighbors. This philosophy, and business style has helped people prosper in our community for over 93 years.\n\nToday we are 10 locations strong, serving Clallam, Jefferson, Kitsap and Whatcom Counties from Forks to Port Townsend to Silverdale to Bellingham. First Federal is rooted in the values and traditions that have strengthened our communities, and to this day continues its commitment to provide the best in financial services and community support, because we are community people! \u2013 less",

Parts are made to our exact specifications and design changes can be made quickly.\n\nOur customers enjoy our ability to quickly provide custom products designed to meet unique requirements.\n\nFASTEST POSSIBLE DELIVERY\nOur extensive inventory is now shipped out of one of our facilities in Seattle WA, Dallas TX and Charlotte NC. The strategic location of these operations allow us to deliver Romac products nearly anywhere in the country in two days or less.\n\nTODAY\nWe\u2019re a little bigger, but our commitment to serving our customers and our customer\u2019s customers is as evident today as it was over 40 years ago. \u2013 less",

    "description":"Heavyweight and belting may be associated with boxing, but Fenner takes them on outside the ring. The company is among the world's top manufacturers of heavyweight belting. Fenner straddles two divisions. The company's Engineered Conveyor Solutions (ECS) Division makes rubber ply, solid woven, and steel cord conveyor belting for mining, power generation, and industrial use. Advanced Engineered Products (AEP) makes polymer products that include precision drives for computer peripherals, copiers, and ATMs; seals for fluid power and oil and gas equipment; rollers for digital image processing; silicone and complex hoses for heavy duty trucks; and power transmission and motion transfer components.\n\nOn the back of robust activity in the company's core markets, especially the energy and mineral extraction sectors, year-over-year revenue rose 30% and underlying operating profit surged 60% - a record -- in 2011. Operating profit went up 67%.\n\nYear-over-year revenue for its largest division, ECS, which supports the company's mining services and accounts for more than 70% of sales, rose 31% in 2011 behind good results in the Southern Hemisphere and strong sales of steel cord conveyor belting.\n\nFenner expanded its business for this division in Australia -- a country that has been especially generous with strong sales -- through the acquisitions in 2010 of Belle Banne and Leading Edge Conveyor Solutions (together known as BBV) and of Statewide Belting Service in 2011. The ECS division operates under the Fenner Dunlop, Fenner, and Dunlop brand names.\n\nYear-over-year revenue for the company's AEP division increased 27% thanks in part to strong sales of seals from customers in the hydraulic and oil and gas sectors. This division comprises five precision polymer businesses. Fenner Precision makes polymer components for office automation equipment. Fenner Drives designs and customizes systems and products for motion transfer applications. James Dawson provides silicone and hoses for heavy equipment.

Solesis Medical Technologies includes Secant Medical (textiles for implantable medical devices); Xeridiem (single use disposable devices); and Prodesco (industrial fabrics.).\n\nFor the AEP segment the company acquired two companies in 2011: Singapore-based Mulitseals, which makes seals for the Asia\/Pacific oil and gas industry, and Australia-based Transeals, which makes seals for hydraulic equipment.\n\nFor its business as a whole Fenner is optimistic about further growth in response to several trends. Fenner Drives, Fenner Precision, and James Dawson are positioned to meet growing demand for energy efficiency and renewable energy in response to concerns about climate change. Xeridiem and Secant Medical are expected to benefit from an increasingly aged demographic in the developed world and the general expansion of health care in Brazil, Russia, India, and China.

We are recognized as a leader in workers\u2019 compensation, and have proudly sold work comp insurance since the company\u2019s founding in 1915.\n\nOur innovative products insure businesses throughout Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana. Society\u2019s customers include small to mid-size businesses in niche markets including restaurants, taverns, hotels, and convenience stores. This niche-focused approach allows us to offer the products we know best to the types of businesses we know best.\n\nAt Society, value is central to everything we do. Our style of customer service is designed to provide uncommon value to each customer. This means a lot more than pricing our services competitively. It extends into every aspect of our relationship with policyholders and agents.\n\nCulture:\n\nSince 1915, we\u2019ve insured businesses that have the same Main Street mentality as we do. Some of the very things that make us just like you are exactly what set us apart from other insurance companies.\nSociety is a mutual company, owned by our policyholders. There are no outside stockholders or investors to distract our focus away from Society\u2019s customers and employees. The autonomy we enjoy makes priorities very clear.\n\nWith just under 300 employees, we are small enough to have a flexible approach to doing business \u2013 an environment where all employees feel a sense of ownership. At the same time, our long history and deep roots provide the stability that people value in an insurance company.\n\nWe\u2019re serious about our business, yet we recognize that work is just one part of our lives. In our office, having fun is not only allowed but expected. Flexible scheduling, ample time off, affordable health insurance, and enviable retirement plans back our belief in a healthy work\/life balance for everyone.\n\nBenefits:\n\nTo help ensure financial well-being for our employees, Society offers competitive salaries, incentive compensation plans, and a host of insurance and retirement benefits. The health and dental insurance plans provide extensive coverage at low out-of-pocket costs. Our 401(k) plan features a strong discretionary company match, 100% funded by the company. Society also pays short and long-term disability coverage as well as employee life insurance.\n\nPrincipal Financial Group named Society one of its nationwide 10 Best Companies for Employee Financial Security. We are pleased to be a member of The Principal 10 Best Alumni Association.\n\nWe want employees to make the most of their time away from the office. Society is proud to offer flexible scheduling that can fit your schedule. (Want every Tuesday morning off? Provided business needs are met, it\u2019s yours.) Employees start with 15 paid days off per year in the first full year of service, and receive 20 days off after five full years of service.\n\nSociety also provides benefits to help employees achieve more on a personal level, whether in the classroom or the gym. Tuition reimbursement pays for up to 100% of college course costs, and we have an extensive insurance education system that features free, onsite classes. The health club down the street is not only convenient, but free to use through Society\u2019s corporate membership. \u2013 less",

    "reviews":469,
    "description":"Who knew you could find religion just by throwing open the doors to your closet? True Religion Apparel designs and markets upscale denimwear. The company's apparel offerings -- including jeans, skirts, jackets, and tops -- are sold under the True Religion Brand Jeans in major cities on six continents: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America. It also markets swimwear, eyewear, footwear, and fragrances. True Religion Apparel peddles its pricey products through upscale retailers, such as Bloomingdales, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and some 700 high-end US boutiques. The company also operates about 100 US stores and 10 overseas under the True Religion banner, and sells apparel online.\n\nThe company's jeans, which account for about 70% of total sales, are priced from $168 to $376 per pair and are stitched together with fabrics from the US, Turkey, Japan, and Italy. Branding its products as \"Made in the USA,\" True Religion outsources all of its production to contract manufacturers around the world. (Its men's and women's denimwear is sewn and finished by manufacturers in the US, its children's denim and fleece apparel are made in Mexico, and its knit shirts are made in the Far East.) To complete production, some apparel is then sent to laundry and finishing centers around Los Angeles.\n\nGiven the relatively high price points of its apparel, you'd expect sales to have suffered as a result of the global financial crisis, which depressed demand for luxury goods in many markets. However, True Religion Apparel's sales have more than doubled from about $173 million in 2007 to more than $363 million in 2010. Net sales climbed nearly 17% in 2010 vs. 2009 after rising by about 15% in the previous annual comparison. Sales at the company's US stores and online business jumped more than 46% in 2010 due to the addition of 24 new stores and a nearly 10% gain in same-store sales. The company attributed the strong same-store sales gain to its strategy of offering new styles regularly in its retail stores. The company's US wholesale business didn't fare as well, logging a 15% decline in 2010 vs. 2009, after falling nearly 20% in the previous annual comparison.\n\nSales outside the US rose by about 18% in 2010, driven by a new joint venture in Germany and the opening of stores in Cologne, London, Tokyo, and Toronto. In 2011 the apparel maker expects to add another 15 US stores and about 10 overseas. As demand from its wholesale department store customers falls, True Religion Apparel is looking to compensate by growing its own store network and online business.\n\nTrue Religion Apparel was founded in 2002 by its chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lubell. Columbia Wanger Asset Management owns more than 10% of the company's shares. \u2013 less",

The company offers prepared salads, dips and spreads, Mexican foods, ready meals, and other specialty products under such brand names as Baja Caf\u00e9, Reser's American Classics, and Stonemill Kitchen, as well as the Don Pancho brand of corn and flour tortillas, and newly-acquired Vaughan. Reser's products are sold primarily through national supermarket chains and other grocery retailers in all 50 US states and Canada. The side dish firm, which boasts a dozen US production sites, also produces items for food service customers. Founded in 1950 by Mildred and Earl Reser, the company remains family-owned.\n\nStrategy\n\nReser's growth strategy includes acquistions to bulk up and gain entry to new markets. Evolving, the firm joined Oregon's list of largest privately held companies late 2011. It managed to do so by teaming up with Mistral Equity Partners in a $62.2 million bid for bankrupt rival Chef Solutions. The offer scooped up most of Chef Solution's assets and its operating subsidiary, Orval Kent. The move is likely to propel Reser's to a billion dollars in sales. Chef Solutions, which makes a variety fresh salads and other refrigerated side dishes for many of Reser's customers, strengthens Reser's presence in the market for fresh prepared foods.\n\nReser's entered the fresh-cut market in mid-2011 by buying out family-owned Vaughan Foods. The $18-plus-million deal, which made Vaughan a subsidiary of the company, expanded Reser's portfolio with fresh-cut fruits and vegetables, soups, sauces, prepared salads and salad kits, and side dishes. It also stretched the company's reach in the foodservice and retail sales channels. As part of the acquisition, Reser's took ownership of Vaughan's primary manufacturing facility in Moore, Oklahoma, and its plant in Fort Worth, Texas, which makes soups and sauces. \u2013 less",

Its video relay service (VRS) is used by hard-of-hearing people to conduct video calls to hearing individuals over the Internet using the company's digital video phone device and a television monitor. Communication is enabled by a video link to a sign language interpreter at Sorenson's facility who is visible on the monitor and translates signed messages into speech for hearing callers. The company's related free IP relay service (SIPRelay) enables text-to-speech calls from mobile devices or PC's to standard telephones.\n\nSorenson has further addressed the home PC market and burgeoning wireless data communications market by expanding its VRS product line to include software (nTouch) that enables customers to use PC's, as well as mobile phones running on the Android platform (introduced in 2011), instead of dedicated video phone devices to communicate using its services.\n\nSorenson's products are used by customers in the fields of education, media, and government, among others. \u2013 less",

The company manufactures sturdy, disposable tableware and food packaging, as well as shaped paperboard, plastic, and molded fiber plates, cups, bowls, and trays under the Chinet brand for  foodservice customers and consumers. Huhtamaki Americas also supplies flexible packaging products for goods such as baking and snack foods, detergents, personal care, electronics, and pet foods. Product extensions include dinner napkins and guest towels. The company operates a dozen plus facilities in North America and Mexico, and is the regional headquarters for Finland's global packaging giant Huhtam\u00e4ki Oyj.\n\nHuhtamaki Americas generates more than one-quarter of its parent company's consolidated revenues. Thanks to favorable currency exchange rates, revenues attributable to the Americas unit increased slightly in 2010 over 2009. Year-over-year earnings, however, decreased 18%, eroded by declining demand from both retail packaging and consumer goods customers hurt by a down market.\n\nSales are also a reflection of a competitive industry that sues at the drop of a cup. In spring 2010 the company prevailed against charges by Dixie Consumer Products, part of Georgia-Pacific, that Huhtamaki Americas had copied the design style of its insulated cup used for hot drinks. A judge tossed out the lawsuit, ruling that the white band around the Chinet cup's bottom was not an aesthetic choice but a functional move intended to cut the cost of insulating materials. \u2013 less",

    "description":"Spartan Motors has built itself on the foundation of its chassis. Founded in 1975, Spartan Motors (through its core Spartan Chassis unit) makes custom chassis for fire trucks, motor homes, and other specialty vehicles, including mine resistant and light armored vehicles for the US military. The company also manufactures emergency vehicles through three subsidiaries that make up its Emergency Vehicle Team (EVTeam) segment. Its Crimson Fire subsidiary builds fire truck bodies, while its Crimson Fire Aerials business makes ladder units for fire trucks. Other operations include subsidiary  Utilimaster, which makes custom walk-in and hi-cube service and delivery vans, truck bodies, and other commercial vehicles.\n\nLike many of its competitors, Spartan has experienced dismal sales and shrinking profits in recent years. Its losses can be attributed, in large part, to shaky economic conditions in the US (its primary market), declines in demand for consumer products like motor homes, and volatile fuel prices. What's more, with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan winding down, demand from the US government for the company's military vehicles is also falling. \n\nTo mitigate its losses, Spartan Motors has been diversifying its offerings through acquisitions and product development. In 2011 it bolstered its Crimson Fire and Spartan Chassis businesses by purchasing fire apparatus manufacturer Classic Fire. The addition brought new technology and a strong product portfolio (tankers, brush trucks, and mini-pumpers and light rescues), as well as additional coverage in the emergency response market. Spartan has also been leveraging Utilimaster's commercial truck-building operations to expand its product offerings and attract new customers. The subsidiary recently began producing an eco-friendly commercial van (the Reach NGCV) in 2011 that offers improved gas mileage and reduced CO2 emissions. The company also entered into a partnership with Isuzu Commercial Trucks of America in 2011 to produce gas-powered Isuzu N-Series delivery trucks.\n\nThe 2009 acquisition of Utilimaster contributed to the rise in Spartan Motors' total revenue in 2010. Excluding Utilimaster's revenues, Spartan Motors as a whole experienced a slight decline in sales and remains well below its peak 2008 revenue levels.\n\nIn addition to its growth efforts, Spartan Motors has been selling off some businesses as well. In late 2010 it sold ambulance maker Road Rescue to Allied Specialty Vehicles (which owns ambulance OEM Collins Industries). \u2013 less",

Founded by the state legislature, the hospital began operations with 125 licensed beds. During World War II, the hospital became a convalescent facility. In 1947, it was remodeled and returned to the community as an acute care general hospital. In 1986, the hospital was designated as the area's only Level II Trauma Center and changed its name to Halifax Medical Center.\n\nIn 2007, after many additional services were added, Halifax Medical Center became Halifax Community Health System, and recently chose to simplify the name to Halifax Health. Halifax Health is the area's largest healthcare provider with a tertiary and community hospital with 678 licensed beds, more than 500 physicians on its medical staff representing 46 medical specialties. Halifax Health also offers psychiatric services, four cancer treatment centers, the area's largest hospice organization, and a preferred provider organization.\n\nOUR MISSION is to be the community healthcare leader through exceptional talent and superior patient centered service delivered in a financially sustainable manner.\n\nOUR VISION is to develop talented teams dedicated to providing competent, accountable patient centered healthcare in a financially sustainable manner.\n\nOUR VALUES\nHalifax Health will cultivate a positive workplace in which each team member is valued, respected and has an opportunity for personal and professional growth.

A part of top US power firm Duke Energy, the regulated utility provides electricity services to about 2.4 million customers in North and South Carolina. Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.\n\nThe utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.\n\nThe global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.\n\nIn 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. \u2013 less",

Local legend has it that the community\u2019s earliest leaders looked upon the rolling hills of the area and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a grand view?\u201d Hence, the name for this quaint community located minutes south of Kansas City along Interstate 49.\n\nGrandview is where 33rd President Harry Truman grew up working on the family farm. Today, the collective hard work from decades of active leaders has put Grandview on the map as one of the highest-ranked school districts in Missouri, home to nationally recognized parks and distinguished police and fire departments.\n\nGrowth in Grandview is constant. Exciting projects on the horizon will positively impact the future\u2014like the redevelopment of Truman\u2019s Marketplace underway now and construction of the state\u2019s largest amateur sports complex, Gateway Sports Village, coming in 2017. We have only scratched the surface as the fastest growing city in Jackson County, Missouri.\n\nOne of the most attractive qualities about living, working, and visiting Grandview is the ease of experiencing its many amenities. It\u2019s no accident. Grandview executes thoughtful development that influences growth AND works for everyone. For Grandview, it\u2019s not about fitting the conventional description of a city; rather it\u2019s about devoting efforts to build a genuine reputation on progressive, engaged and desirable development for the people who call Grandview home and the businesses who build here.\n\nGrandview has always pursued the future with immense perseverance and resourcefulness. It is our hard work in response to obstacles that has led us to great victories. Every move Grandview makes as a city government is mindful of our community. Growth is a collaborative process shaped by a true dialogue among public and private partners. There is no better time to be in Grandview. Join this great city as we do the job at hand: Building Tomorrow\u2019s Community. \u2013 less",

    "description":"It's all about connections, connections, connections -- and Tensolite, dba Carlisle Interconnect Technologies, is well connected. Carlisle Interconnect designs and manufactures high-performance wire and cable, radio-frequency\/microwave connectors, and cable assemblies for the commercial and military aircraft, defense electronics, wireless infrastructure, optical telecommunications, and test and measurement industries. It has operations in California, China, Florida, and Washington. In 2008 Tensolite acquired Carlyle Inc., and the merger was re-branded Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. It is part of the Applied Technologies segment of parent company Carlisle Companies.\n\nThe two companies combined staffs, technologies, and products to create Carlisle Interconnect Technologies -- a single company focused on the expansion of its product and technical capabilities. It specializes in aerospace grade copper and optical fiber cable assemblies and harnesses used in wing, cockpit, and avionics systems. The assemblies connect to instrumentation, sensors, and other types of system support and control devices. Carlisle Interconnect Technologies also manufactures coaxial cables, microwave connectors, electrical panel and cabinet assemblies, as well as provides electronic engineering, design, and manufacturing services to OEMs in military and aerospace, test and measurement, automatic test equipment, and medical and industrial markets. Brand products include Tensolite High-Density Shielded Interconnects (HDSI), High Density RF Interconnect (HDRFI), Tufflite 2000 airframe wire, and NETflight optic cable, to name a few.\n\nDue to the global economic recession, Carlisle Interconnect Technologies was forced to close its cable manufacturing plant in Vancouver, Canada, in late 2009. Production was moved to one of the company's three US facilities. Carlisle Interconnect Technologies explained that one of its largest customers, Tektronix, was hard hit, as well, by the recession, and had to decrease its orders. \n\nBut amid economic difficulties and low demand, the company welcomed new acquisition Electronic Cable Specialists (ECS) in October 2009. Wisconsin-based ECS designs and manufactures electrical and structural products and services for use in aviation, industrial, and medical applications. ECS is expected to complement the company's specialty wire and cable operations and expand its engineering capabilities for customers in the avionics and commercial aircraft industries. Also in 2009, to boost its portfolio for defense electronics and avionics for military and commercial aerospace applications, the company acquired Jerrik, a military and aerospace filter connector manufacturer based in Arizona.\n\nCarlyle Inc. was a supplier of aerospace and network interconnection products. It manufactured cable assemblies, rack and panels, and cable and wire harnesses for in-flight entertainment systems and specialty avionics. The acquisition brought new customers and built on Tensolite's product portfolio.\n\nTensolite, the name of which was derived from tensile and lightweight, was founded by Henry Dudley Minich in 1940 as a research laboratory. Its first products were used to heat fighter pilots' gloves and suits electrically in WWII. Four years later the company began focusing on insulated wire. It became part of the Carlisle group of companies in 1960. \u2013 less",

After identifying dictation and paper documentation management as two of her practice's biggest expenses, she started looking for a web-based documentation solution that was designed for PTs. But, there wasn\u2019t anything on the market that met her needs. Faced with the decision to implement a subpar solution\u2014one that would require Band-Aid fixes to make it align with her staff\u2019s workflow\u2014or build her own, Jannenga opted for the latter. And boy, are we glad she did, because it wasn\u2019t just her clinic that needed this type of software solution. In 2008, Jannenga and her co-founder launched WebPT and sold to five clinics in the first month. Ten years later, WebPT is now one of the fastest-growing software companies in Arizona and one of the fastest-growing EMR platforms in the country. A decade after launching, we\u2019re serving more than 12,000 clinics and 83,000 customers nationwide\u2014around 30 percent of the entire outpatient rehab therapy market.\n\nWebPT has become a mission-critical technology that has disrupted the rehab therapy industry, changing the way tens of thousands of providers are documenting, protecting, and sharing patient information. Our mission has always been to empower rehab therapists to achieve greatness in practice, and to fulfill that mission, we\u2019ve remained steadfastly committed to innovation that benefits our customers directly.\n\nTo that end, we\u2019ve expanded our platform\u2014through internal growth and acquisitions\u2014to be more than a stand-alone electronic medical record (EMR) software; we now offer integrated scheduling, billing (software and full-service RCM), analytics, outcomes tracking, home exercise program, and a patient relationship management (PRM) platform, which enables rehab therapists to stay at the leading edge of interoperability, data collection and analysis, security, meaningful use, and patient experience.\n\nToday, most of our employees\u2014about 300\u2014work in our headquarters in downtown Phoenix, Arizona, but we also have hubs in Denver, Colorado; Boston, Massachusetts; Upland, California; Dublin, Ohio; Oakdale, Minnesota; McDonough, Georgia; Newport News, Virginia; and Saco, Maine.

By 1997, DeltaHawk developed a prototype engine running on a static Velocity airframe. At the time, DeltaHawk had established the mission:\n\nTo design, produce, distribute and support lightweight turbo-diesel engines for a variety of aviation and non-aviation uses\n\nThat mission holds true today as DeltaHawk continues to anticipate and exceed the needs of general aviation. In 2015, DeltaHawk plans to test and certify their multi-fuel (Diesel or Jet-A) 160-200 horsepower engine family for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification.\n\nThe family of engines will become the smallest, lightest, most fuel-efficient and reliable multi-fuel engines on the market. General aviation pilots and mechanics will have an exceptional solution to comply with United States EPA fuel standards by January 2017.\n\nWe are a well-funded start-up company, seeking top talent to help us build our culture and gain exposure in the industry! \u2013 less",

    "description":"Electrical Consultants, Inc. (ECI) was incorporated in 1985 as a result of the purchase of the telephone engineering division of its predecessor, Associated Engineers, by Pacific Telecom, Inc. ECI established a small office in Billings, Montana to continue to serve the electric utility and industrial clients the firm had worked with for up to 25 years. The company has grown significantly since its humble beginnings and currently employs almost 400 professional engineers, surveyors and technical staff performing project design work throughout the United States and abroad.\n\nOperating from ten major regional offices throughout the United States, ECI has expanded its presence as one of the country\u2019s leading T&D consulting design firms. ECI\u2019s staff consists of highly experienced and qualified individuals available to coordinate and direct engineering efforts for any number of services. Our tremendous depth of professional staff helps to assure completion of projects in minimal response times and includes individuals with highly specialized or unique experience that ensures prompt and qualified responses to any project work scope item, whether it be a simple design question or one that involves complex, regional issues.\n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, EPC Services Company (EPCS), was formed in 2000 to provide a professional based Project Management\/EPC firm to handle the demand for utility and independent power delivery projects having ever shorter times for completion. Some of the first projects undertaken by EPCS were the construction of fiber optic regeneration sites for long haul, high bandwidth communications. However, changing market demands quickly resulted in the steady growth of EPC Services Company for traditional utility projects as well as major industrial loads having customer-owned facilities. Because of this, EPCS has quickly grown from a small company to one of the very largest specialty Engineer-Procure-Construct companies in the United States.\n\nECI\u2019s motto of \u201cEngineering with Distinction\u201d is not only meant as a sign of commitment to our clients but also serves as a reminder to our staff that distinction comes from being innovative, and innovation combined with quality keeps you at the forefront of the pack. \u2013 less",

    "description":"HISTORY\n\nPacific Coast Building Products\u2019 origins go back to February 17, 1953, the day Fred Anderson opened the doors to Anderson Lumber Company in Sacramento, California. In preparation for that day, Fred and his wife Pat put all they owned up for collateral in exchange for a bank loan. After leasing a piece of property, they bought an old delivery truck, enough inventory to last them a couple of months, and placed a small ad in the Sacramento Bee newspaper announcing the opening of Anderson Lumber.\n\nPABCO Gypsum began manufacturing gypsum board after its 1972 acquisition of an idle gypsum plant Newark, California that was built in 1955. Five years later, PABCO expanded its gypsum manufacturing capabilities with the acquisition of a Johns-Manville gypsum plant and quarry north of Las Vegas, Nevada. The Las Vegas facility was expanded and modernized in 1998 and again in 2005; and Newark was updated in 2009. The acquisitions continue with the purchase of QuietRock in 2013, which brought the world's first sound reducing drywall panel into the PABCO family. Our complete line of gypsum products is used in virtually all types of construction from residential to high-rise structures.\n\nPABCO Paper joined the PABCO family in 1984. The plant however, began making paper in 1912, over one hundred years ago as Southern Board and Paper Mills in the industrial city of Vernon, California, southeast of Los Angeles. In the 1920's it became a division of Fiberboard Products and sold again in 1977 to Pacific Coast Packaging Company. After sitting idle for several years, the plant was acquired and upgraded to enable production of high quality paper initially for our gypsum board products. Today in our historic building, PABCO paper turns pre-and post consumer recycled content into new paper products used as gypsum board facing and backing paper, packaging paper for bakery boxes and other paper goods.\n\nPABCO Roofing Products got its start as another acquisition of idle plants. The 1984 roofing products acquisitions included a plant in Richmond, California, whose production dated back to before WWI and a Tacoma, Washington plant dating back to 1955. Both plants were operated and eventually made idle by the CertainTeed Corporation. Within 24 hours of the acquisition, the Tacoma facility was back online producing shingles. Over the years our roofing product line has adapted to changing technologies and customer teste. We made the swtich from organic felts to fiberglass core to laminated shingles. Today the Tacoma plant produces 10 different lines of asphalt shingles including our patented Cascade shingle.\n\nOur company \u2018house\u2019 logo was designed years ago with the sides not touching. The slight separations signify that our company is never complete, but always evolving, open to new products, innovations, and ideas. Those beliefs were important factors in building our business and remain critical to our future success \u2013 less",

To keep up with changing demands, Dr. Scott gradually transitioned Potomac Animal Hospital into a state of the art small animal practice with grooming and boarding. Dr. Scott purchased the property and house adjacent to the hospital building in 1993 making way for plans to expand the hospital and build a boarding kennel. Finally, on November 3, 1997 we broke ground for the expansion and our first new boarders came on Thanksgiving in 1998.\n\nFor many years Dr. Scott was the sole veterinarian. As the practice began to grow the need for another veterinarian arose. In 1999, Dr. Scott's son, Dr. Jason Scott, joined the practice as a full time veterinarian. Dr. Christine Morrow joined the practice in 2011 and recently in 2016 we added Dr. Elizabeth Mooberry. \u2013 less",

    "description":"In 1982, Mark started his career as a Carpet Cleaner for a local Medina company. The owner of the company taught Mark a great deal about the janitorial business and eventually offered to sell him an old Chevy truck with a carpet cleaning unit in 1984. Unable to afford office space, Mark based his new company out of this old Chevy. In the early years, Mark single-handedly cleaned a number of office buildings between carpet jobs. In addition to cleaning and operating his new business, Mark began to advertise in the local newspaper and pass out flyers whenever he could.\n\nBy 1986, the company was quite busy cleaning day care centers in Akron, as well as factories in Medina's industrial district. Seeing the success of his service, Mark decided it was time to expand. He formed a partnership and created a new Floor Care division to meet the demand of new clients. Mark and his partner learned a lot about the building service industry, but they ultimately decided to part ways after five years. After splitting the business, Mark began to wear every hat. His wife Bonnie helped manage the company finances as he learned to sell janitorial contracts.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1996, Mark's Cleaning Service focused on hiring an abundant, professional cleaning staff as the company saw exponential growth in clientele as well as profit. Mark sought the help of an Operations Manager to oversee the staff while he ran the company. Mark and his Operations Manager completed the company's certification with IICRC in Carpet Cleaning, Water Damage Restoration, Carpet Spot Dying, and Upholstery Cleaning. By the mid-1990s, Mark's Cleaning Service became a member of Building Service Contractors Association International (BSCAI), rented a 3,000 square-foot building, added three carpet cleaning trucks, and purchased a large inventory of water damage equipment. The company had grown to a staff of forty and was poised for even more growth. In April of 1998, Mark and Bonnie found a 5,000 square-foot building on South Elmwood Avenue two blocks from the Medina Square. They purchased the building and hired an office staff largely through the promotion of current employees that displayed hard work and ambition. \u2013 less",

    "description":"FCSB is a vibrant, thriving, all-inclusive bank because of our amazing team members.\n\nOur History\n\nSince 1999 First Central Savings Bank (or as the community knows us, FCSB,) has grown from a simple concept to what we are today: a vibrant, thriving, all-inclusive community bank that hasn\u2019t wavered from its original aim of friendly, personalized service. We are committed to enriching our communities, driving local economic growth, and cultivating lasting relationships by putting the best interest of our clients first. These values are a summary of who we are as individuals and how we conduct ourselves as a bank. They\u2019re also a statement of how we view our responsibilities to each other, to our communities, and to the world in which we all live.\n\nOur goal is to fill a void in banking by providing old-fashioned personal service with a smile; a throw-back to the days of hospitality and good manners that we were all raised on, something you just won\u2019t find anywhere else. We are a true community bank in that we make our decisions locally and have a vested interest in the people and businesses we serve. While our footprint has certainly grown, we take pride in playing an active role within the local communities we serve by knowing our customers and understanding their unique needs.\n\nWith our corporate center and branch in Glen Cove, NY branches are conveniently located in:\n\n\u2022 Astoria\n\u2022 Ditmars\n\u2022 Bayside\n\u2022 Whitestone\n\u2022 Flushing\n\u2022 Ridgewood\n\u2022 Forest Hills\n\u2022 Glen Cove\n\nWe strive to offer you a highly personalized approach to banking. It\u2019s banking the way it used to be, only better.\n\n\nWhy join us? FCSB's corporate center and our branches have a creative team atmosphere that encourages the ideas and input from all contributors. That's our mission: to support our staff and clients just like we would our own family. It's a simple philosophy and it shows in our work and dedication. We are always looking for high-energy individuals willing to learn and grow with us. That's what a family does: we learn, we grow, we build. Management strives to empower their team members to work to their fullest potential and have a great time doing it!\n\nWe offer a competitive benefits package with health, dental, vision, FSA, 401k, Life\/AD&D, supplemental benefits, and paid time off. We're also a coffee and tea lovers spot too, that means there's a Keurig with various flavors in every department, depending on tastes of course. It's true - there really is. But there's a lot more to us than a cup of joe. If you'd like to learn more and talk about your future with us, check out our jobs section then contact our Human Resources Department at 516-399-6065. We'd be happy to hear from you! \u2013 less",

    "description":"About Us\nWe are a Christian based, family owned company founded in 1999 by Mike and Melissa Hollingshead.\n\nOur Story\nWe got started in the concrete business in the early 1990\u2019s as concrete finishers. Our finishing business continued to grow and in the late 90\u2019s the local ready mix companies struggled meeting our service demands. This helped drive the decision to get into the ready mix business. At first, we were only concerned about selling concrete to ourselves but soon after we got started in business, other finishers began calling.\n\nOur first plant was built in the backyard of our first home, at 4500 Hickory Grove Road in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. We had no experience in the business, nor did we know anything about concrete plants, but we figured it out and built the first plant ourselves. It was a struggle getting the money necessary to buy our first plant and to be able to buy the three trucks that we acquired at auction, but by hard work and the grace of God we made it through. The plant has been up and running for nearly two decades, and so much of our history is here.\n\nWe have since added over 1,000 employees and now have locations that span across the Eastern half of the United States.\n\nOur mission from day one has been to take pride in producing quality concrete and provide top-notch customer service. Our team works diligently each day to produce quality concrete mixes and meet the delivery schedules of our customers. Our group of mixer operators is unmatched and they make our business run. We are thankful for the dedication of all of our team members. Their dedication has allowed us to grow our business into what it is today. \u2013 less",

    "description":"Prosperity Bancshares reaches banking customers across the Lone Star State. The holding company for Prosperity Bank operates 213 branches in and around the Texas cities of Dallas, Houston, Austin, Corpus Christi, Lubbock, and San Antonio. Serving consumers and small to midsized businesses, the bank offers traditional deposit and loan services, in addition to investment services through third-party provider LPL Financial. Prosperity Bank focuses on real estate lending: Commercial mortgages make up the largest segment of the company's loan portfolio (35%), followed by residential mortgages (27%). Business, construction, consumer, home equity, and agricultural loans round out its lending activities.\n\nProsperity Bancshares operates banking locations in Houston, South Texas, the Dallas\/Fort Worth metroplex, East Texas, Bryan\/College Station, Central Texas, and West Texas.\n\nProsperity Bancshares bases its growth strategy on three key elements: Internal growth; cost controls; and acquisitions. Net income has climbed steadily since 2008 due to an increase in net interest income. The increase in net interest income is a result of balance sheet growth from a slew of recent acquisitions. Net income grew by 10% in 2011. Assets, deposits, and loans also have seen an uptick thanks to those acquisitions.\n\nThe acquisitive Prosperity Bancshares has been buying up small banks in Texas as it hopes to hit a sweet spot in the market between the national giants that dominate the Texas banking scene and smaller community banks. Compared to many of its peers elsewhere in the country, the company has remained prosperous (and profitable) during the economic downturn, thanks in part to its presence in the relatively stable Texas market, its conservative loan underwriting standards, and growth through acquisitions.\n\nIn 2010 it bought some 20 locations from First Bank, and acquired three branches that U.S. Bancorp divested from its acquisition of the failed FBOP Corporation. The deals strengthened Prosperity Bank's presence in the Dallas and Houston areas.\n\nIn early 2012 Prosperity acquired Texas Bankers, a three-branch Austin bank with some $72 million in assets. The merger increased Prosperity's number of Central Texas branches to 34 banking locations. It followed that deal with the purchase of The Bank Arlington, a single-branch bank operating in the Dallas\/Ft. Worth area. The company also plans to buy East Texas Financial Services, adding another handful of branches to its network. It acquired single-branch Community National Bank of Bellaire, Texas, in late 2012.\n\nAlso in 2012, Prosperity expanded into West Texas after it merged American State Financial Corporation and its American State Bank subsidiary into its operations. The deal added 37 West Texas banking offices in Lubbock, Midland\/Odessa, and Abilene. The deal added about $3 billion in assets to Prosperity's roster.\n\nProsperity Bancshares was founded in 1983 \u2013 less",

At that time, \u2018direct\u2019 meant a catalog and a toll-free number. We were sure this more efficient and convenient process would save customers' time and the absence of a visit by a commissioned sales person would allow 4imprint to pass substantial savings on to our customers.\n\nThat first catalog was 12 pages long, went to 250,000 businesses and it wasn't much to look at by today's standards \u2014 but it was a thing of beauty to us \u2014 and it marked the beginning of a journey that has allowed 4imprint to become the largest direct marketer of promotional products.\n\nAlso, critical to our vision for the company has always been the belief that in order to offer incredible value, we must provide incredible service \u2014 and service is all about people. We strive to create an environment where people are valued and respected. After all, associates who are passionate about their work are naturally inclined to share that enthusiasm with everyone they encounter. \u2013 less",

Started in 1996 by Michael Gilhool Sr., the business has steadily grown to what it is today.\n\nMichael built his craft while working in the display shop for a Philadelphia based painting company. The display shop constructed and maintained all the paint store\u2019s cabinetry and fixtures. Shockingly, Michael was informed that the display shop was closing and his position at the company had been eliminated. \u201cA blessing in disguise\u201d Gilhool called it. He then presented the idea for the company to barter all the shop machinery and tools in exchange for (2) new store location cabinetry and fixtures. With humble beginnings, Michael started the business above a Doctor\u2019s office in South Philadelphia, PA. Only able to work at night due to the noise, he later moved to Naamans Road Business Park, which housed the business for nearly 20 years. In 2017, American Wood Design moved it\u2019s operations to Chester, PA, expanding from 5,000 sq. ft. to 16,000 sq. ft.\n\nFast forward to today, American Wood Design has advanced with state of the art technology for all your custom cabinetry needs.

    "description":"Cain and Abel they're not! Brothers and executives Joe and Mike Zeiden founded Z Gallerie in 1979, using their parents' garage for a warehouse and production facility. Initially Z Gallerie (later joined by sister Carole Malfatti) sold poster art, but in the 1980s the trio added home furnishings and accessories to the merchandising mix. Today Z Gallerie stores, which span some 10,000 sq. ft. on average, feature bedding and pillows, dinnerware, glassware, rugs, lamps, candleholders, clocks, frames and albums, games, and gifts. The firm's eclectic pieces are sold through its website and some 55 US retail locations in nearly 20 states. Z Gallerie exited Chapter 11 in fall 2009 after a six-month stint in bankruptcy.\n\nSince emerging from bankruptcy protection, Z Gallerie spends its time prudently shopping for new locations for its shops while the company keeps a close eye on the performance of its existing stores. The furniture retailer opened a store in Redmond, Washington, and in late 2011 opened two more shops: one each in Texas and Georgia.\n\nPrior to its April 2009 bankruptcy filing, the furniture seller shuttered about 20 underperforming stores and a distribution center in Atlanta in response to the slowdown in the economy. The closures caused the firm to exit several markets, including Ohio, consolidate its network of distributors, and shed about 350 employees.\n\nZ Gallerie blamed its financial woes on the recession and competition from going-out-of-business sales held by competitors as the recession took root. The company said that it filed for Chapter 11 to strengthen its balance sheet and to get out of the lease obligations associated with the closed stores and distribution facility. \u2013 less",

    "description":"Rod Baker opened Rod Baker Ford with his wife and son in the heart of Plainfield in 1963. He came into this business with the determination to treat people fairly and give them a good car buying or servicing experience. Hence our motto \u201cHome of the No Hassle Deal.\u201d In 1992 the dealership relocated from 15303 S. Joliet Rd to its current location. This is also the time when son, Rick, started running the dealership on his own. Soon after, Rod passed in 1994. Having been in the business his whole life Rick has a tremendous love for antique Ford\u2019s which you will often see at the dealership or local car shows. In recent years after being in the business for over 50 years Rick has stepped back to let his children, Ricky and Christina begin their journey with running the family business. Both Ricky and Christina share their dad\u2019s passion for cars. Ricky is a late-model stock car racer and Christina has a few antiques of her own.\nOver the years Rod Baker Ford has grown from a few employees to over 90 and has added a second service location in Plainfield called Quick Lane. We also have strong local fleet and commercial business in both sales and service. Our biggest goal over the years has been to move with the changing times and growth but stay true to our family business roots. Over 50 years, and three generations later we are still here carrying on with Rod\u2019s expectations. \u2013 less",

    "description":"Helping People Reach Their Full Potential\n\nAs a parent, guardian or caretaker, you have a dream for your loved ones\u2013that they lead full and successful lives. When a loved one has developmental disabilities, you might think your dream needs to change to a simple wish for the person to be healthy and safe.\n\nAt CSS, we believe that people with developmental disabilities should have the same opportunity as anyone else to maximize the potential of their lives. We work hard every day to help empower them to make their own decisions, integrate into their communities and reach their full potential.\n\nIt\u2019s Personal for Our Family\n\nOur company has been rooted in this philosophy since its founding in 1993. That\u2019s because Dan Swickard is more than the president and co-founder of our company. Dan is a former special education teacher\u2013and the brother of Donna, who had Down syndrome.\n\nCSS is the direct result of Dan\u2019s personal commitment to find the best living situation and support services for his sister. Dan couldn\u2019t find a caring and professional environment he trusted for Donna. That\u2019s when he decided to create an organization dedicated to empowering people with developmental disabilities.\n\nDonna passed away in 2010, but her memory lives in the passion of our organization. Dan\u2019s family, including his son, Chris, who currently serves as one of our area directors, shares this devotion. This passion also drives co-founder, Randy Nipps, and is lived everyday by the entire staff of CSS.\n\nA Higher Level of Caring\n\nCSS trusted in communities throughout Ohio as provider of housing and support services to people with disabilities. We have a long history of empowering individuals, by working in partnership with their families or guardians to be responsive to their loved one\u2019s specific needs.\n\nThe care we provide at a variety of fully equipped residential settings (from assisted living to skilled care), along with supported living services (in the individual\u2019s own home), allows our residents to live life to the fullest as a part of their communities.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to helping the people we serve strengthen their skills and increase their ability to make decisions on their own. We enable our residents and non-residents to become more self-sufficient by training for a vocation, working on behavioral issues or helping with job placement. Then, once employment is found, our staff provides transportation, as needed.\n\nHeadquartered in Newark, Ohio, CSS currently operates in 17 counties throughout the state: Allen, Clark, Champaign, Cuyahoga, Franklin, Geauga, Lake, Licking, Madison, Mahoning, Medina, Montgomery, Stark, Summit, Trumbull, Tuscarawas and Wayne Counties. We also operate three adult day programs \u2013 the James Street Center in Licking County (Newark), the Options for All in Clark County and the HOPE Center in Tuscarawas County. \u2013 less",

The organization was founded by two doctorate level clinicians based on their love for children and their desire to apply their years of the study of learning to children. Dr. Ginger Raabe and Dr. Janice Frederick and their team believe that every child deserves a brighter future and that the path that can lead to this improved success is revealed by examining each individual learner\u2019s needs and then creating an environment to help them flourish.\nThe founding directors of The ABRITE Organization began providing services in Santa Cruz County in September of 2006 and since this time we have expanded our services to Santa Clara County and the South Bay and most recently to Los Angeles and Orange County.\nEach of our sites offers clinical teams who provide many different types of services for many different funding agencies that are all based on the science of Behavior Analysis. Specifically, we are vendored with our local regional centers to provide early start services and behavior reduction services. We also are a non-public agency (NPA) that is certified through the California Department of Education in order to provide educational assistance to our local school districts. We also work collaboratively with school districts in order to co-create and maintain classrooms that utilize educational strategies that have been shown to be effective in the research literature. In addition, we are in contract with many insurance companies in order to provide behavioral services in line with SB946 in the state of California. Moreover, we also provide private services to many local children and their families. We are able to assist many types of learners, from children who are exhibiting a delay in one specific skill area such as communication or social development to children with more global delays.\nUnderlining all of these services is the philosophy that we are and will continue to be a company that does not measure our value by financial prosperity, but instead by the progress of the children and families we serve. \u2013 less",

    "description":"Air Products has consistently impressed the business community with its devotion to corporate responsibility and to employee satisfaction. The company sells gases and chemicals to businesses in a number of industries, including food and aerospace, and it focuses on sustainable practices to help protect the environment. It hires both veteran professionals and recent graduates who are driven to exceed in their careers. Workers gain promotions and other advantages through hard work rather than seniority.\n\nEmployees can contribute to 401(k) accounts to plan and prepare for their retirement, and Air Products matches contributions to a certain percent. The company also provides extensive health, dental, and vision insurance coverage, and employees can take paid sick and vacation leave. Every year, Air Products plans corporate social events to promote unity and teamwork among its staff, and workers receive paid, on-the-job training to help them excel in their roles. For the most part, employees praise the advocacy of a healthy work-life balance at Air Products, though some disagree. A few complain about the company's \"culture that is struggling to evolve\" and its \"lack of direction.\" However, a number of workers rave about the corporate benefits and \"nice people.\" \u2013 less",

He\u2019s a Rancho Santa Margarita resident, and has been since the Toll Road had it\u2019s first car make a beep-beep sound. Along with his team, Jim has been focused on making happy car buyers around here for the past 19 years. (He is also the original and long-standing owner of Santa Margarita Ford)\n\nPeople thought Jim was crazy to open a car dealership in such a remote place back in 1995, but his dad taught him to focus on making happy customers first, and location second. Which is why, when the opportunity came, Jim was able to add the local Toyota store (that\u2019s us \u2013 Santa Margarita Toyota) to his chance of turning local residents into happy local car buyers who don\u2019t have to go far for sales and service. Heaven forbid, even a car dealership people might recommend as a good place to go!\n\nIt all sounds good, right, but you should still be skeptical. After all, we\u2019re still a car dealer. And, to be completely transparent, we\u2019re cleaning up some messes from the previous owners. But if you give us a shot, we\u2019re pretty comfortable saying you won\u2019t be disappointed. No, the better word is \u201ccommitted\u201d to saying you won\u2019t be disappointed. The first place you\u2019ll see this commitment is in our staff, but it\u2019s equally matched by our prices. We\u2019re out for a long relationship with you, and the selling of the car part is where it starts. And that\u2019s always about price. We get it. We won\u2019t get a second chance, so we\u2019ll do it right the first time.\n\nBut these are all our words. What matters is what you think. So browse around our website. Be surprised by our really, really, really big inventory \u2013 and know that we not only most likely have what you want, but if we don\u2019t, we usually get it to you within 24 hours. Shop down to the details on line, if you\u2019d like. We\u2019ll give you all the pricing information you want via email, text, phone or even Instagram! The more you do on line, the faster the process goes when you get here. And we know that\u2019s what you want. Funny, it\u2019s what we want, too.\n\nWe\u2019ve been saying this throughout this message: We get it. We get you. We know what you want in the car buying (and servicing) process. As we said before, people just like you work here.\n\nWe know the only way we will succeed is to be the dealer that gets you \u2013 that gets it. But the proof will be when you see it for yourself. And we hope you\u2019ll give us the chance. \u2013 less",

    "description":"Aloha! Maui Land & Pineapple (ML&P) invites you to live and play on its Hawaiian island -- Maui. Through its Kapalua Land Company subsidiary, the company operates the 1,650-acre Kapalua Resort on Maui's northwest coast. The resort includes a minority-owned Ritz-Carlton hotel, as well as tennis and spa facilities, residential homes and condos, and shops and restaurants. ML&P also develops residential and commercial property on its 23,000 acres surrounding the resort. Its Kapalua Realty Company is a general brokerage real estate firm located within the resort. The company additionally owns forest and nature preserves on the island. Formerly one of Hawaii's largest pineapple producers, the company exited that business in 2009.\n\nRevenues declined slightly in 2010 compared to 2009 because the company ceased to own The Kapalua Villas (vacation rental) and Kapalua Adventures (zip lines, ropes course, and other activities), choosing instead to lease those businesses to third party operators. However, its net income soared to nearly $25 million, up from a loss of more than $123 million. In 2010 ML&P gained on the sale of its Kapalua Plantation Golf Course, as well as the termination of post-retirement plans for employees of discontinued operations. In addition, due to the real estate crash and the subsequent decline in tourism, the company lost considerable profits from its 51%-owned Bay Holdings in 2009. (Bay Holdings owns the Residences at Kapalua Bay condos.)  In order to cut costs, ML&P eliminated more than 600 jobs in 2010 and 2009.\n\nAfter David Cole resigned from his five-year stint as chairman and CEO at the end of 2008, the company split the functions, appointing Warren Haruki (former president of GTE Hawaiian Tel and Verizon Hawaii) as chairman, and Robert Webber as CEO. Months later Webber resigned. Haruki serves as chairman and interim CEO, a position he has held since 2009.\n\nBecause of soaring oil and transportation costs, ML&P exited the pineapple business in 2009, saying it could no longer sustain financial losses that threatened to destroy the company. It had grown pineapples on Maui for almost 100 years. \n\nML&P board member and AOL co-founder Steve Case owns more than 60% of the company. Through his Revolution LLC, Case has a majority interest in Exclusive Resorts, which has a 15% stake in Bay Holdings. Marriott International  owns the remaining 34% of the condo project. \u2013 less",

    "description":"Got gas? With no embarrassment, Luxfer Gas Cylinders has. The company makes aluminum and composite high-pressure gas cylinders. Its lineup offers compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicles, CO2 and mixed-gas cylinders for beverages, extinguishers for fire, as well as life-support cylinders for medical and recreational scuba markets, and paintball cylinders for players. Luxfer's manufacturing process uses hydraulic rams to shape aluminum billets into hollow shells, which are closed and threaded. The seamless, lightweight results are ideal for high-pressure storage of gases. Luxfer, part of UK-based Luxfer Holdings, operates plants in the US and UK, France, and China, serving customers in more than 50 countries.\n\nThe company has responded to the challenges of the economic downturn through an internal restructuring and facility expansion. Among its targets, Luxfer aims to court new market opportunities for lightweight CNG cylinders, used in passenger cars, and increasingly in heavy duty natural gas vehicles. Fuel tank weight is critical for commercial businesses, notably in CNG countries like Europe, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East. Along those lines, in mid-2012 parent Luxfer Holdings agreed to acquire CNG and other fuel cylinder maker Dynetek, which has factories in Germany and Canada.\n\nLuxfer is making headway by developing relationships with AFV Fleet Service\/FAB Industries, BAF Technologies, Enviromech Industries, Omnitek Engineering, Paccar Inc., and World CNG. In 2010 Luxfer opened a fuel system assembly plant in Italy, the Luxfer European Alternative Fuel Centre. The Centre, a joint venture with Enviromech, opens the door to customers rapidly adopting CNG technologies. In Latin America, Luxfer inked a distribution deal to enter Peru with Omnitek, a natural gas vehicle equipment specialist.\n\nProduction of the CNG cylinders and liners is centered in Luxfer's Riverside, California, facility, a facility that gained from Luxfer's move in 2008 to consolidate its manufacturing operations. All aluminum cylinder manufacturing was moved from Riverside, California, to plants in Graham, North Carolina, and Nottingham, the UK. Composite cylinder operations were merged in Riverside, along with large-diameter composite liner manufacturing, moved from Huntington Beach, California. The restructuring revamped Riverside, but eliminated 140 jobs or more than 10% of Luxfer's workforce.\n\nLuxfer also pursues recreational markets. The company touts the world's widest range of aluminum and carbon-composite paintball cylinders. \u2013 less",

    "name":"DCP Midstream",
    "rating":3.5,
    "reviews":222,
    "description":"DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

    "description":"New York Life Insurance has been providing life insurance policies in the Big Apple since it was a tiny seed. While the top mutual life insurer in the US has branched out a bit, it retains its core business: life insurance and annuities. Its products include long-term care insurance and special group policies sold through AARP and other affinity groups and professional associations. New York Life Investments' offerings include mutual funds for individuals and investment management services for institutional investors. Through New York Life International, the firm provides life policies in overseas markets. Founded in 1841, New York Life is owned by its policyholders.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nNew York Life operates service and marketing offices throughout the US. The company also operates offices in Mexico, Taiwan, and India.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nNew York Life distributes its products primarily through its network of some 17,000 career agents in the US, while it relies upon more than 51,000 agents to represent its products outside the US. A network of brokers represents the company's corporate and bank-owned products and those aimed at high net-worth customers.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company, like many of its rivals, considered demutualizing and turning itself into a public company at one point. However, after encountering resistance from legislators, New York Life eventually dropped plans for such a change. Demutualizing would have allowed it to make riskier investments, but it also would have made it vulnerable to being gobbled up in a merger. As a result of remaining a staid old mutual, the company's comfy cushion of capital reserves saw it through the economic crises of 2008 and 2009. Unlike its public competitors, New York Life retained its pristine ratings, and even saw its earnings increase.\n\nIn 2011 New York Life and its subsidiaries achieved revenue growth of about 2% to $23.8 billion, mainly driven by a 10% increase in premiums. The company's net income fell by about 29% to $1.3 billion, mainly due to a 7% increase in expenses, including benefits and liabilities for future policy benefits. The firm's surplus, however, increased 6.5% to $17.9 billion. Individual life insurance in force increased 4% to $790 billion, and assets under management increased 10% to $338 billion. The company paid out more than $7.6 billion in benefits and dividends in 2011.\n\nStrategy\n\nNew York Life bases its strategy on protecting its financial strength, which it does by conservatively refusing to take risks or gamble on its policyholders' dime. The firm manages its investments for long-term strength through its own research and analyses, and as a result, it does not fall into deficit. More than 90% of New York Life's invested assets are in fixed-income investments diversified across multiple industries and regions. The company has been able to avoid such pitfalls as subprime mortgage debt and exposure to sovereign debt in Europe by sticking to its principles.\n\nNew York Life has used some its considerable capital reserves to expand into international markets over the years, targeting areas where life insurance markets are not yet mature, especially in Latin America and Asia. However, while New York Life seeks to expand in select emerging markets for the long-term, the company has also been divesting some noncore international operations in 2011 and 2012. It is also expanding its investment management operations through its New York Life Investment Management (mutual funds, group and individual retirement plans, college savings products).\n\nDivestitures\n\nIn 2011 the company sold its life insurance operations in Hong Kong and Korea to ACE Limited for about $425 million. It then went on to sell its 47% stake in Siam Commercial New York Life Insurance Public to its Thai partner in the business, Siam Commercial Bank, for about $280 million. Then, in 2012, it agreed to sell its New York Life Taiwan Insurance Corp. to private financial group Taishin Financial Holding Co. for NT$100 million ($3.35 million). It also agreed to sell its Fianzas Monterrey unit, which provides surety insurance in Mexico, to ACE Limited to focus on its core life operations in the Mexico market (conducted through Seguros Monterrey).  \u2013 less",

Splash offers while-you-wait express detailing and a more comprehensive drop off Five Star Detailing every day. Many of our locations offer traditional express conveyor washes and a number provide oil change services on site. Splash Car Wash was founded by Mark Curtis and Chris Fisher with the opening of their first hand wash \u2014 Splash, Greenwich. Both lifelong Greenwich, CT residents Curtis and Fisher cast aside their business suits and ties to immerse themselves in suds and water with the purchase of Greenwich Car Wash in 1981. Eventually renamed Splash Car Wash in 1994, to mark a totally innovative concept developed by Curtis and Fisher for washing cars on conveyor by hand in a tunnel, overwhelming response to their new hand wash became the catalyst for phenomenal growth at Splash. \u2013 less",

    "description":"You don't have to be royalty to be a patient at Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters (CHKD). CHKD is Virginia's only free-standing, full-service pediatric facility, and as such provides medical, dental, and therapeutic services to children and adolescents through the age of 21 years old. The 210-bed hospital has a staff of more than 500 physicians, and has the state's only dedicated pediatric emergency center, which gets more than 47,000 patient visits each year. CHKD also operates several outpatient pediatric centers throughout the state. The not-for-profit system was formed in 1961.\n\nThe CHKD Children's Medical Group operates 15 primary care practices for children throughout Virginia and in northeastern North Carolina. \n\nLike most of the rest of the health care sector, CHKD saw some difficult financial times in 2008 and 2009. As a result the hospital froze nearly 100 non-clinical vacant positions in early 2009. It also closed its on-campus day care center and made some staffing cuts.\n\nDespite the some rough financial waters, CHKD began construction on a new health center in late 2008. The 60,000-square-foot, three-story building -- slated to open in late 2009 -- will house surgical group practices, sports medicine, radiology, specialists offices and outpatient clinics; Chesapeake Pediatrics, a primary care practice, and a community meeting room. \u2013 less",

In addition to auto coverage, the company provides a range of personal property\/casualty and life insurance products to more than 3 million policyholders. Auto-Owners Insurance Group operates through subsidiaries including Auto-Owners Life Insurance, Home-Owners Insurance, and Property-Owners Insurance Company. Its Southern-Owners Insurance subsidiary offers property\/casualty insurance in Florida. Auto-Owners Insurance also sells commercial auto, liability, and workers' compensation policies. Established in 1916, the company operates in 26 states nationwide and is represented by more than 6,000 independent agencies.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nAuto-Owners operates 85 claims, underwriting, and marketing offices in its 26-state service territory. The company's largest markets are Florida and Michigan.\n\nOperations\n\nAuto-Owners' revenues come from insurance premiums, as well as investment income. The company's property\/casualty business accounts for about 90% of revenues and 80% of profits, with the remainder coming from premiums and income from the life insurance segment.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAuto-Owners reported a 5% increase in net written premiums in 2011 to nearly $5.2 billion, primarily due to growth within the Auto-Owners Insurance, Auto-Owners Life, and Home-Owners Insurance divisions. Total revenues were some $5.7 billion, while net income was reported at $69 million.\n\nStrategy\n\nAuto-Owners is focused on growing its business by establishing strong relationships with independent agents and by diversifying its product offerings. The company has also expanded by adding sales and service facilities in new and existing markets. In 2011 Auto-Owners opened five new branch locations to handle claims in Ashville, North Carolina; Kennesaw, Georgia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Madison, Wisconsin; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

This unique approach separates us from other companies.\n\nOur home-like settings help to provide an environment where our residents are able to develop their social, physical and spiritual wellbeing to reach their highest potential. At Progressions, we currently have seven locations: two homes in Rochester, two homes in Macomb, and one in Oakland, as well as Transitional apartments in St. Clair Shores and a Semi-Independent living program in Sterling Heights. We are the only company with a program of this kind on the east side of Metro Detroit.

We believe life doesn\u2019t stop because of an injury or illness, that\u2019s why we developed a dynamic and unique Life Enrichment program that focuses on the growth of each individual person. The goal of our program is to inspire and guide our residents to a higher level of functioning, which in turn will result in an increased quality of life and self-worth.\n\nOur CHAP Accredited, CMS Certified skilled home health care division provides medical treatment to homebound patients that suffer from an array of health issues. From joint replacement recovery, congestive heart failure symptom monitoring to providing daily wound care, our highly trained team of therapists, nurses, social workers and home health aides provide reliable and compassionate skilled care services. Our mission is to help patients achieve an improved level of care with compassion and life enrichment. We pride ourselves on being big enough to service a wide range of patients across many locations, but small enough to provide a more personable and higher level standard of care.\n\nWhile redefining home health care, providing exceptional residential services, and having a superior care team, we also provide personalized private duty home care services that are delivered with compassion and life enrichment. Our private duty care division handles cases that range from 90 minute bath visits to providing care 24 hours a day.

    "name":"GameStop",
    "rating":3.5,
    "reviews":8800,
    "description":"GameStop holds the top score in video game retailing. Operating under the GameStop, EB Games, and Micromania banners, it's the largest retailer of new and used games, hardware, entertainment software, and accessories. It boasts nearly 6,700 stores in the US, Europe, Australia, and Canada. By carrying about 4,500 items, including more than 3,000 used video game titles, a majority of GameStop's revenue is generated by sales of new and used video games and their software. The company also sells downloadable add-on content from publishers. GameStop operates several e-commerce websites, offers GameStop TV in many of its locations, and publishes Game Informer, a video game magazine with some 7.2 million subscribers.\n\nStrategy\n\nDespite the gloomy selling forecast for retailers during the past few years, GameStop has logged its greatest revenue increases during the recession and beyond. It's seeing the largest gains among used video game products as the company lures more frugal customers who want to stay in the game even with tighter budgets. For used items, revenue rose from 23% of 2009 revenue to 28% in 2012. More consumers are turning to existing video game products, rather than new, due to their availability and cost-effectiveness. That bodes well for GameStop, because used game products (with their higher gross margins) is the company's most profitable segment. To maintain its foothold in new and used gaming, GameStop continues to target hardcore gamers as well as those niche customers who purchase games as gifts during the holidays. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThose gamers who jockey for the latest and greatest video game software still chose to shop at GameStop, which brought in another 42% of its 2012 revenue from new video game software. GameStop saw slight sales declines, however, among its lower-margin new video game hardware product segment (21% in 2009 to 17% in 2012). The company points to lower consumer demand and price cuts on hardware consoles for the sales slips. The sales decline on new hardware wasn't detrimental to GameStop, though, as the products generate a high single-digit profit margin for the games chain. \n\nGeographic Reach\n\nGameStop operates its stores in the US, Europe, Australia, and Canada.\n\nOperations\n\nGameStop has continued to expand its operations in the US and overseas, but most of its recent sales growth has come from outside the US. In Europe the company has logged revenue increases that have offset sales declines in the US related to decreased demand. Boosting its store count overseas has allowed GameStop to maintain its overall store growth strategy. While expansion from 2011 to 2012 slowed to a mere net 13 stores, the company has reached its current store count through several years of aggressive growth. In 2010 alone GameStop added more than 220 stores to its operations across the board (107 in the US, 88 in Europe, 17 in Australia, and eight in Canada). Albeit, this is modest growth for GameStop, which opened 674 new stores in 2008, 586 stores during 2007, and 421 stores in 2006. (To the uninitiated, GameStop was a much smaller game in town just seven years ago. The company's purchase of rival Electronics Boutique in 2005 doubled GameStop's size.)\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nGameStop is also looking to the Web's game space for growth. In 2011 the company acquired Spawn Labs, which develops peer-to-peer game streaming technology, so that gamers can access their video games and play with others (via an Internet-connected device) even when they are away from home. Spawn Labs sells its streaming applications to game developers. The business is being integrated into GameStop's research and development unit, as Spawn Labs' expertise in virtualization is key to strengthening the retailer's online gaming offerings. Also in 2011 GameStop acquired the Impulse subsidiary of software company Stardock Systems, whose online distribution platform enables gamers to purchase and download games to their computers. Impulse offers more than 1,100 games, a number that is sure to grow with Spawn Labs on board. Prior to these deals, GameStop secured a digital platform in 2010 when it acquired Kongregate, a gaming site launched in 2007 for social gaming that attracts some 10 million users a month. As part of the purchase, Kongregate operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of GameStop and maintains its headquarters in San Francisco.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nThe company considers itself a destination location for gamers. It develops relationships with video game enthusiasts through its PowerUp Rewards loyalty program (launched in 2010) by allowing consumers to trade in used video games for store credits on future purchases. \u2013 less",

    "description":"Be it by air, ground or ocean, BDP International is in the business of moving raw materials and finished products around the globe. The company provides logistics services such as customs brokerage, freight forwarding, and warehousing and distribution for customers in a variety of industries, including chemicals and retail. It serves more than 4,000 customers worldwide, including DuPont, Panasonic, Revlon, and Johnson & Johnson. BDP International and its subsidiaries have about 25 offices in the US; internationally, it operates through subsidiaries, joint ventures, and agents in some 120 countries. President and CEO Richard Bolte Jr. and his family own the company, which was founded by his father in 1966.\n\nTo expand its presence internationally and domestically, the company established the BDP International Global Network, a partnership of small and midsized logistics firms that pool their resources together in order to compete against larger, more global transportation companies. As the logistics industry undergoes a period of consolidation, the global network was also created as a means to keep some of the larger players from snatching up some of the smaller ones. BDP counts about 100 subsidiaries, joint ventures, and partnerships as part of its global network.\n\nThe company continued to expand its borders in 2010. Citing a US and European demand in Vietnamese products, BDP created a subsidiary in Vietnam to serve customers that are sourcing more of their goods from that country. Also in mid-2010 the company acquired the remaining 50% stake it didn't already own in Euromodal, a Spain based logistics, customs brokerage, and warehousing services provider. The business entity, renamed Euromodal BDP International Spain, gives the company a good foothold in the Spanish market, as well as expands its customers' trading options in the Western Mediterranean region. Mexico was tapped in fall 2009 when BDP opened a new office in Mexico City to serve the Latin America market. It plans to start service in Singapore, as well.\n\nBDP definitely has its eye on the Middle East's chemical and petrochemical industry. In spring 2010 it entered into a joint venture with Kanoo Freight-Forwarding based in Bahrain. The company, now named BDP Kanoo Chemical Logistics, is headquartered in Saudi Arabia and offers logistics services, customs brokerage, warehousing and distribution, et al. Around the same time, it also partnered up with India-based Unique Global Logistics in a joint venture valued at more than $5 million. BDP holds the majority stake with 65%.\n\nBDP International also strengthened its position in the UK market in 2009 when it acquired Rostrum Forwarding, a freight forwarding firm. The deal gave BDP International access to receiving depots in Birmingham, Bristol, Heathrow, Leeds, London, and Manchester.\n\nAdditionally, BDP also added value to its services by obtaining PIP (Partners in Protection) certification. PIP is Canada's equivalent to the US Customs and Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program. Companies, especially those in the chemical industry, which represents about 65% of BDP's business, are finding more and more that they must prove PIP compliance. In essence, PIP operates as a security program for the commercial sector that is actively trading across borders. PIP members adhere to program guidelines to ensure that all procedural security measures are met. \u2013 less",

From the onset, COPC physicians have always been dedicated to finding new ways to offer the best patient care.\n\nToday we have more than 70 practices and serve more than 400,000 patients. However, what\u2019s most notable isn\u2019t our size, but that we have grown beyond the primary care office.

The company\u2019s original focus in the specialty food division stemmed from their USDA Inspected manufacturing facility, and in the late 80\u2019s began gradually incorporating a wide line of imported specialty foods to service their restaurant and gourmet retail market accounts. Taking a wide leap forward, today Despa\u00f1a Brand Foods continues to be a family run operation that has earned a very strong presence as a recognized leading importer of authentic, high quality, brand name food products exclusively from Spain.\n\nAs the NY ambassadors of the Spanish food culture, the products they import help to influence and elevate gastronomy and food culture here in the US, blending traditional, old world ingredients with new world, avant garde flavors and cuisine. Despa\u00f1a Brand Foods extends through their network of select distributors located in strategic regions of the USA, such as Florida, Maryland, Chicago, Seattle, Las Vegas, and Puerto Rico to name a few. Their large customer base is composed of respected chefs, restaurant operating groups, hotels, think tanks directors, food boutiques, gourmet stores, and culinary teaching institutions.\n\nThe company\u2019s arms of influence expanded in 2006 touching the retail gourmand consumer by opening the first, and still currently the only, NYC specialty food boutique offering authentic products from Spain. In 2011, their reach continued with Despa\u00f1a Vinos y Mas, a sister boutique specializing in Spanish wines and liquors. The store operates conveniently next to their flagship food boutique and caf\u00e9 in the fashionable neighborhood of Soho, NYC. In Summer of 2012, Despa\u00f1a Princeton was launched in Princeton NJ, as their first joint venture partnership located outside of NY.\n\nTheir chorizo factory and original small retail store front remains located in Jackson Heights, Queens, with the corporate headquarters and warehouse facility for distribution located in Woodside, Queens.\n\nThe company mission is of a continued commitment and responsibility to bringing quality, authentic Spanish foods and products to the U.S, with a dedication to educating their customers. Their aim is to maintain a cultural bridge \u201cfrom Spain\u201d (Despa\u00f1a) to New York, providing and using great ingredients, paired with excellent wines and spirits all presented among the universal experience of social cheer and enjoyment of food.

Other products include cowl vent grilles and fuel filler doors. Services provided by ADAC Automotive include design, molding, painting, and assembly. Its ADAC Technologies subsidiary is a leading supplier of plastic moldings, subassemblies, and decorative finishes.

It manufactures products that include latching systems, lock sets, door handle components, exterior trim, and lighting products. Major customers include Ford, General Motors, Johnson Controls, and Nissan, among others. Considering the intense economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, especially for the automotive industry in the US, VAST helped mitigate the losses by generating revenue outside of North America, especially in developing vehicle manufacturing markets such as Asia and South America.\n\nThe automotive industry experienced declines averaging 40% in mid-2009, with more than 50 automotive suppliers filing for bankruptcy protection. ADAC weathered the downturn, but not without cutting 25% of its workforce. As the industry recovers, forecasts for 2010 and beyond predict increased sales for automotive suppliers. \u2013 less",

    "description":"History of DSI\nDSI originated in 1969 when Sheriff A.B. Clark started a security company in response to a request from the construction company building the nearby Farley Nuclear Plant. As the company\u2019s reputation grew for providing quality security services DSI began to grow, opening an eventual 20 branch offices. A.B. Clark began DSI with the belief that his company could fill a void with a dependable, competent team of people. DSI now consists of thousands of carefully selected and highly trained security personnel.\n\nDSI is still a family-owned and managed company, led by A.B.\u2019s son Alan, Chairman of the Board, along with his wife Marty, President. Alan and Marty\u2019s three children all work with DSI in various capacities as well. DSI has also benefited from its well-rounded, experienced, and professional management staff that have helped in building DSI\u2019s reputation as a leader in the security industry. Following sound business practices through the years DSI has been able to maintain a high quality of clientele. Many of our clients have experimented with less expensive security suppliers prior to choosing DSI, but have ultimately chosen the more personal way of doing business DSI provides.\n\nThe DSI Team\nDSI adheres to the philosophy that the success of any organization is in direct correlation to the quality of its employees and to the service that they provide their customers. In implementing this philosophy and steering away from expanding their growth with \u201cwarm bodies\u201d, DSI has been able to develop a well-respected image in the security industry. DSI believes that success is bred in the recruiting, selection, supervision, and training of each and every employee. Believing in the need for ongoing and perpetual training helps to set DSI apart from its competitors. Many companies give testimonials about their commitment to customer service and employee satisfaction but few deliver on that promise. That is where the DSI motto, \u201cDWYSYWD\u201d, comes into the picture. Simply stated, DSI strives to \u201cDO WHAT YOU SAY YOU WILL DO\u201d.\n\nThe staff at DSI believes that if we understand the culture and mindset of our customers then we can more easily create a unique service solution to reflect it. DSI strives to create a work experience for our employees reflecting the work culture, principles, and values of our clients as well as of DSI, and based upon this, we screen employees for skills, philosophies, and attributes that reflect both. In doing so, we believe DSI delivers employees and service mutually beneficial to everyone. \u2013 less",
